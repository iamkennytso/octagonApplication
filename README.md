# octagonApplication

This is an application for Octagon. It's a Doublelift fan site, which currently only has his 
YouTube videos.

## Team

  - __Developer__: Kenneth Tso

## Usage

From within the root directory:
```
npm start
```

## Requirements

- Node v8.7+

## Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

npm install

Application is built mainly on Node, Express, and React JS. Axios is used for back end calls, Compression
for compression purposes, and material-ui for styling.
JQuery could have been used instead of react-scroll, but I thought it made the code more readable.
